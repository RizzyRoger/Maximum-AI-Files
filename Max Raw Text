The Oppressed
By: Max Wang


Chapter 1: Nathan, July
        Nathan Francis was a 23-year-old man from Elmwood Village. He was a normal man, with a normal job and a normal life. Nathan had completed high school, graduated from college, and gotten a job at Alpha Market, a local supermarket operated by the renowned Knox Corporation. He chose this job because of the high salary Knox Corporation provided, and how easy it was to work there. In addition, Knox Corporation claimed to be a very sustainable company through the usage of wind turbine power plants, which are tall turbines that convert the kinetic energy of wind into electricity.
Nathan was definitely the right person for the job…he was friendly, hardworking, and optimistic. Slowly, he began climbing the ranks, becoming more and more popular and well-known amongst his colleagues. In one year alone, Nathan had gone from a plain cashier to a store manager. Now, Nathan was getting ready to be promoted to a factory worker and finally get a job at the Knox Corporation headquarters (which was, interestingly, right next to Elmwood Village…). However, in the back of his mind, there was one thing troubling Nathan…the population of his village was dropping fast, almost at the same rate he was climbing the ranks…
Chapter 2: Elmwood Village, July
Elmwood Village was a modest and peaceful community. The residents of the village were cordial and warm, and everyone enjoyed their humble, quiet lives. However, that all changed drastically. While Elmwood Village had an initial population of  12,368 in January, it had unusually dropped to 11, 243 by March. Everyone thought that the sudden drop in population was expected, since the flu was exceptionally strong that year, but this claim would be completely dismissed in May, when the population plummeted to 7,089. Then, in July, the population dropped again, resulting in only 5,321 people remaining. In a matter of a few months, more than half of the people in Elmwood Village had mysteriously passed away. The once  bright, cheerful Elmwood Village had become dreadful and dark. Cries of family and friends could be heard from almost anywhere, nearly every house was draped in black, and swarms of pallbearers marched down every street. Local news reported that such an extreme drop in population had only ever been seen in places that had experienced nuclear disaster. Worst of all, nobody knew how to stop this dreadful crisis.
While everybody was frantically searching for ways to protect their families, Nathan was pondering on how to find a cure. After a while of thought, he concluded two things. Firstly, every poor soul that had passed away died from the same cause: cancer. Secondly, the deaths coincidentally started happening the same month Knox Corporation opened its factory right next to Elmwood Village…


Chapter 3: The Factory, July
Nathan was very excited for his first day as a factory worker. With this new job, he would get almost 50% more money than a store worker. In addition, many others had told him how grand and stunning Knox Corporation’s factory was. However, he was still staggered to see how immense and great the factory actually was with his own eyes. Unable to accept that he would be working in an environment so different from the miniscule Alpha Market, Nathan eagerly rushed inside to see what was in store for him. As he passed through the huge steel gates that encircled the factory, Nathan saw thousands of workers operating on enormous machines that processed the ingredients and turned them into food products. Giant tubes carrying ingredients for the Knox Corporation’s famous food products ran throughout the factory, which passed into places where they would then be processed and packaged. Nathan was assigned to work on one of the ingredient-mixing machines that mixed dough and other elements together. These ingredients would then be baked into bread in another part of the machine. The other workers had told him that their job was quite easy; they just had to supervise the machines and monitor the heat of the baker. Nathan was confused at first, since he had originally thought that his job would be placing food on conveyor belts and dumping ingredients into buckets. However, his colleagues had laughed and told him that the factory was mostly run by machines, and the only humans needed were workers. Nathan’s colleagues had also told him to focus on working instead of asking questions. They said that although there weren’t any managers in the factory, Knox Corporation always seemed to know what they were doing…
By now, Nathan had started to notice a few strange things around the factory. For one, there were lots of security cameras all over the factory. At first, it seemed that the cameras were just for security, but after trying to count every single one he saw (there were just too many), Nathan concluded that the overwhelming number of security cameras were not just there for that. Secondly, all of the machines and tubes were enclosed, so nobody knew what was happening inside of them or what ingredients they were carrying… This made Nathan suspect that Knox Corporation didn’t want their employees and the public to know what ingredients or additives they were putting in their foods. Finally, after counting how many machines there were in the factory, Nathan was certain that the amount of energy required to operate such immense machines and tubes was at least double the amount of energy a wind turbine power plant could produce. After pondering over all of these, Nathan was certain that Knox Corp. was hiding something. However, it didn’t seem to be anything harmful or illegal, so Nathan continued to work hard and tried to stop worrying about these things.


Chapter 4: The Offices, September
        It had happened again. The population of Elmwood Village had once again plummeted, and with that, Nathan had been promoted. During his time at the factory, Nathan had been a great leader. He maintained friendly relationships with everyone, he performed his work diligently, and he had helped with many things like repairing a control station, introducing the factory to new recruits, and even creating a scrumptious new food product. Seeing that he was a natural leader, Knox Corp. had generously decided to promote Nathan to an executive who was allowed to work at the offices.
Nathan, as always, was very excited for his new job. He wondered if he would be as amazed as he was last time about his new workplace. As Nathan boarded the private bus Knox Corp. had sent to take him to the Offices, he noticed that there were security cameras everywhere and that the bus didn’t even have a driver. Instead, it was AI-controlled and Nathan felt very uncomfortable looking around at all the security cameras, so he straightened his posture, tried to act as serious as possible, and quietly waited.
One hour later…
        Nathan stretched his legs as the bus doors automatically opened. It had been a long ride, and trying to maintain a good posture for that long was very exhausting. As he exited the car, Nathan gazed at his surroundings and felt a little bit confused. He had expected the Knox Corporation Offices to be in a large and crowded city. Instead, they were here, in an isolated desert. As Nathan approached the sleek, black doors leading into the offices, two burly security guards, both carrying M16s, stopped him and demanded his ID card. Nathan was very frightened, but then maintained a relaxed composure and pulled out his new ID card Knox Corp. had just given him for inspection. After observing the ID card, the guards almost instantly smiled and welcomed “Mr. Nathan Francis” (as they had called him) into the office. When he entered the office building, Nathan immediately recognized the familiar presence of security cameras everywhere. Indifferent, Nathan walked up a flight of stairs to his room, eager to start working. However, at the top, he was met with a horrifying sight. Hundreds of managers stared down at their computers, closely monitoring everything that was happening through the security cameras. Nathan’s hypothesis was confirmed. He now knew for a fact that every single security camera he had seen was being watched. The lack of privacy made him quite wary, so Nathan hurried down the corridor and into his office. Inside his office, Nathan found a simple desk, an office chair, and a huge monitor. After swiping his ID card to open the computer, Nathan noticed that Knox Corporation had sent him a file labeled the “Executive Loyalty Examination”. After Nathan clicked on it, a series of instructions popped up. It said that Nathan had to complete the test to prove his loyalty to Knox Corporation. It also said that this was required in order for him to start his job as an executive. Although he was puzzled as to why he had to do a test to show his loyalty, Nathan still filled out the test. However, just when he was about to submit, another file popped up on his screen. This time, he knew it wasn’t from Knox Corp. as it was labeled S.O.L.A.R.sAvEm0nths3579.exe. At first, Nathan was unsure of whether to click it or not, wondering if it might be a virus. However, his curiosity ultimately prevailed, and Nathan clicked the file. Instantly, bold and black letters appeared in front of his screen.

Recap: In the Oppressed, we followed the story of Nathan Francis, a 23-year-old man from Elmwood Village. Nathan had originally been a cashier at the local Alpha Market, but since he performed exceptionally well, he quickly got promoted to a factory worker. He would continue to climb up the ranks, becoming an executive who was allowed to work in the Offices. Unfortunately, his villages’ population was dropping just as fast as he was climbing the ranks. In January, there were 12,368 people. Then, the population plummeted, and in July, there were only 5,321 people alive. At the same time, Nathan began to notice a few strange things about the company, Knox Corporation. At first, he did not think that Knox Corp. was linked to the villages’ extreme population decline. This, however, all changed on Nathan’s first day at the Offices after a mysterious file popped up on his screen…
Chapter 4.5: The ending of The Oppressed
This time, he recognized that the file wasn’t from Knox Corp. as it was labeled S.O.L.A.R.sAvEm0nths3579.exe. At first, Nathan was reluctant to click it, wondering if it might be some sort of a virus. However, his curiosity ultimately prevailed, and Nathan clicked on the file.

Chapter 5: Dilemma
        Nathan was dumbfounded. He didn't know what to do. He buried his head into his arms as his heart and mind raced. After quite a while of shock, Nathan began to ponder the message. Now that a mysterious organization had sent him this message linking Knox Corp. to Elmwood Village’s population decrease, Nathan began to connect the dots. He remembered how secretive Knox Corporation was. There were security cameras everywhere, no one could see what was happening inside the food processors, and the Offices were situated in a secluded desert. Not to mention, Knox Corp. had definitely been lying about using wind turbine power plants to supply energy, since it was impossible to produce such an immense amount of power using the kinetic energy of wind. However, Nathan was still troubled by a few important questions: How were these things linked to his villages’ population drop? What evidence was there to prove these claims? What is S.O.L.A.R.? Nathan was trapped in a dilemma. He didn’t know whether to trust Knox Corporation or S.O.L.A.R. Despite this, Nathan was certain about one thing: He had to save his village.
Chapter 6: The Meeting
        That night, Nathan didn’t sleep well. He kept wrestling with who to trust, Knox Corp. or S.O.L.A.R. One was a secretive, suspicious company, while the other was a cryptic and unknown organization. The next day, Nathan came to work weary (he didn’t sleep at all) but excited. On the bus ride, Nathan had thought of an idea that could give him information about both Knox Corp. and S.O.L.A.R. He would send an undisclosed message to S.O.L.A.R. saying that he is indeed skeptical of Knox Corp. However, he would also say that he doesn’t fully trust S.O.L.A.R., and therefore that he required an explanation in order for him to join the organization. After sending this message, Nathan almost immediately got a response:
Hello, Nathan. These are indeed very good questions to ask. However, we cannot reveal these details to you right now, since we cannot fully trust you, and you are being watched. Nevertheless, we will eventually give you the information you need. We will send you a messenger in three days from now at midnight. They will bring you to us, and we will have a crucial meeting.
Three days later…
Nathan stood outside his door, waiting for the messenger to arrive. At 12:00 sharp, a sleek, black car stopped in his driveway. A man wearing black sunglasses stepped out of the car and walked up to Nathan. As he shook Nathan’s hand, he beckoned him towards the car. Reluctantly, Nathan entered the car…
“Hello, Nathan. It is a pleasure to meet you. I’ve heard a lot about you and your actions, and I believe you would really make a great addition to our team.”
“You knew about me already? How?”
The cryptic man chuckled and motioned to the driver. “Why, of course it's because of him!”
The driver turned around and smiled at Nathan. Nathan was so shocked to see who it was, he almost fell off his seat. “Robin!?” He exclaimed.
To Nathan’s disbelief, the driver was Nathan’s best friend, Robin Bernard. The mysterious man explained that his name was Raynell, and that he was the head of S.O.L.A.R. He also told Nathan how he had met Robin, and what they knew about Knox Corporation.
        “Thirteen years ago, I created the Society of Liberation and Rescue, abbreviated as S.O.L.A.R. This organization has been aiding people and animals from around the world. Our organization has saved countless animals from abuse and found cures for unknown diseases. Two years ago, I met your friend, Robin. He is a brilliant man, as you should know, and he found a cure for a deadly disease known as KOVID-29. This year, he told me about your villages’ extreme drop in population. We both know that this is very unusual, and that there must be some cause for this. We began by investigating the cause of the deaths. Since everyone who passed away died of cancer, we started looking for cancer cells. For the first six months, we found nothing, but just a month ago, we found out that the soil, air, and water in your village contains lethal amounts of radioactivity that has caused the residents to develop cancer. We also found out that there were many illegal additives in Alpha Market’s food products. Due to this, we began to secretly investigate your company, Knox Corporation. We concluded two very important points: Firstly, Knox Corporation is very corrupt, and it is putting many illegal additives in its products that can cause cancer. Secondly, the radioactivity in your villages’ soil may suggest that there is nuclear waste, although we don’t know where it came from and why it’s there.”
“So is that what you want me to investigate?”
“Correct. Since you are a high-ranking executive, you have the right to inquire about any company secrets. However, for them to fully let their guard down, you must fill out the Executive Loyalty Examination.”
“But…the final question on the form says that you must swear on your life that you will never betray Knox Corp.”
“Are the consequences actually that harsh and strict?”
“Yes. Knox Corporation has hundreds of thousands of security cameras everywhere, and I think they even have their own SWAT force.”
Raynell pondered for a moment, and then asked Nathan, “We will try to send reinforcements, but this mission will still be very risky, and possibly even life threatening. Would you still like to participate? I would understand if you-”
“Yes. I will participate in this mission, no matter the cost. I must save my village and everyone I hold dear to me.”
“Thank you, Nathan. Thank you for striving to save the people of this society.”
Chapter 7: The Plan
        At S.O.L.A.R. headquarters in Athensvale, Raynell introduced Nathan to everyone else. They all liked Nathan very much and admired him for his bravery. Raynell convened a meeting with everybody else in the organization. He explained that Nathan would continue to work at Knox Corp. undercover and collect as much information on Elmwood Village’s population decline as possible. He also split S.O.L.A.R. into two groups: One would investigate the radioactivity in Elmwood Village, while the other would reinforce Nathan and help relay information. Finally, Raynell gave an stirring speech that moved everyone to tears, restating the purpose of S.O.L.A.R.: Liberation and Rescue, no matter what.
After the meeting, everyone, especially Nathan, was determined to save Elmwood Village. As he headed home, Nathan thought about the challenges he was now about to face. He was now a special man, with a special job and a special life.

The Truth
By: Max Wang


Recap: In the Quiet Rebellion, we followed the story of Nathan Francis, a 23-year-old man from Elmwood Village. After receiving a mysterious message from a cryptic organization called S.O.L.A.R., Nathan grew suspicious of his company, Knox Corp. When he first joined Knox Corp., half a year ago, the population of Elmwood Village began plummeting unnaturally. At first, Nathan didn't think that his village’s extreme drop in population was linked to his company. This is because everyone believed at first that the deaths were caused by the abnormally strong flu. However, after S.O.L.A.R. sent a message to Nathan informing him that his company was linked to the population drop, Nathan connected the dots. He organized a meeting with S.O.L.A.R. 's leader, Raynell, and discovered that his best friend, Robin Bernard, was also a member of S.O.L.A.R. In addition to this, Nathan also found out that his village contained lethal amounts of radiation, and that Knox Corporation’s food products held illegal additives that caused cancer. As a result, Nathan joined S.O.L.A.R., and he was assigned a difficult and extremely important task: Nathan would go undercover as an agent and reveal Knox Corporation’s dark secrets and save his village…


The day after the meeting…


Chapter 8: The Loyalty Examination
        The next day, Nathan came to the Knox Corp. Offices with an anxious expression and a thin, sealed smile. Every time he saw a “security” camera, Nathan would picture himself getting caught and arrested by Knox Corporation’s “security” officers. As Nathan approached the sleek doors leading into the Offices, he saw a bunch of SWAT officers, wearing kevlar vests, and holding shiny, lethal M16s. He imagined his head being pierced by their bullets and felt as scared as a mouse in a snake’s den. Nathan quickly hurried up the stairs and into his office cubicle, since he didn’t want to see any more security cameras or supervisors. After regaining his composure, he opened his computer and started the first step of his mission: The Executive Loyalty Examination. Nathan quickly filled out the form and answered every question without hesitation...until he got to the last question. It said:
Question #44
WILL YOU SWEAR ON YOUR LIFE THAT YOU WILL NEVER BETRAY KNOX CORPORATION?
        Option 1: Yes
        Option 2: ?
        Nathan took a deep breath and once again pictured himself getting arrested and executed. However, this time, he also remembered the pain and agony of his neighbors, who both died of cancer the first month Nathan got hired at Knox Corp. Determined, Nathan checked the yes option and submitted the form. In less than a second, a message from Knox Corp. appeared on Nathan’s computer screen:
Thank you for filling out the form.
REMEMBER–IF YOU BETRAY KNOX CORPORATION, NOTHING SHALL SAVE YOU FROM YOUR FATE.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
Chapter 9: The Investigation
        After filling out the Executive Loyalty Examination, Nathan was formally allowed to start his work at the Offices. His job was quite simple; he only had to attend Knox Corp. board meetings and contribute to their discussions. However, the most crucial part of Nathan’s job was not this, instead, it was an annual factory check. Every year, all of the executives would gather together at the Knox Corp. factories and for one week straight, they would perform test after test on every single machine and tube in the factory to check if any were broken or in need of maintenance. When Nathan used to be a factory worker, he had experienced the annual factory inspection. He could still clearly recall the day when all of the factory workers were suddenly ushered out of the factory. They were then escorted onto huge black buses that delivered each of them home. When Nathan had inquired about why they had to go off duty so early, one of his colleagues had informed him that it was most likely because of this annual factory check that forced everyone to return home early. Now, after having remembered all of these things about the annual factory inspection, Nathan concluded that the factory check must be very secretive. This is because none of the factory workers were allowed to see it, and the inspection took an entire week. Nathan also realized that since the annual factory check was so secretive, he would definitely be able to uncover some confidential information when he inspected the factory…


Three months later…


        It was finally time for the long awaited factory inspection. During the previous night, Nathan had sent a private message to Raynell. In it, Nathan indicated that he would inform Raynell of any secrets that he would uncover during the week of the factory check. The next day, Nathan boarded the huge buses that Knox Corporation had sent, and after an hour-long drive, he arrived at the Knox Corp. factory. Just like before, Nathan saw that all of the factory workers had been led into buses and taken back to their homes. After there was no one left, Nathan and the other executives exited their buses and entered the factory. Inside, it looked the exact same way it had on the day Nathan got promoted. Humongous food processors were present throughout the factory, and gigantic tubes were hooked up to all of the machines. Nathan suddenly felt a surge of nostalgia and excitement, so he strolled into the immense factory and began inspecting.


        Over the course of the next six days, Nathan and the other executives inspected every single inch of every single machine and tube in the factory. They performed meticulous inspections on each food processor and even checked all of the security cameras in the factory. Unfortunately, Nathan was too busy checking the food processors, and as a result, he didn’t have any time to start investigating. Due to this, he became increasingly bored and discouraged, seeing that the factory inspection would not reveal any of Knox Corporation’s secrets. However, on the night of the sixth day, one of the chief executives told everyone that the seventh day would be the most important, and that there would be hundreds of SWAT officers guarding outside the factory. Alarmed, Nathan quickly sent a private message to S.O.L.A.R. headquarters, telling them that he would uncover the truth on the next day.


The next day…


        After eating breakfast, Nathan and the other executives hurried into the factory at 9:00 sharp. When they arrived, the chief executive was already there. He gave everyone a speech about loyalty and secrecy, and informed them that they would be inspecting confidential things today. Then, the chief executive led Nathan and the other executives to the back of the factory and into a secret door concealed inside the wall…


        It was at this moment that Nathan realized the truth. It was at this moment that Nathan broke through all of Knox Corporation’s lies. It was at this moment that he knew why his village was being devastated by cancer.


        It was all because of Knox Corporation’s nuclear power plant. Nathan had finally connected all the dots together. He now knew how Knox Corp. produced enough energy to power all of the machines in the factory. He now knew why Knox Corporation was so secretive. Most importantly, he now knew why his village’s population was plummeting so rapidly…


        The nuclear power plant’s radioactive waste was being dumped in Elmwood Village.

The Catalyst
By: Max Wang


Recap: In The Truth, we followed the adventures of Nathan Francis, a 23-year-old man from Elmwood Village. After joining S.O.L.A.R. (a.k.a. The Society of Liberation and Rescue), Nathan became an undercover agent to uncover Knox Corporation’s secrets and discover why his village’s population was decreasing so rapidly. During the annual factory inspection, Nathan was led into a secret room concealed behind a hidden door at the back of the factory. In this room, Nathan discovered that Knox Corp. was using a nuclear power plant to power its massive machines. He finally realized that his village’s population was dropping because Knox Corporation was dumping its radioactive waste there. Now, he was ready to denounce Knox Corp.’s crimes to the world and save his village…


Chapter 10: The Arrest


        Nathan now knew everything. He knew his company’s darkest secrets. He knew why his village’s population was dropping so substantially. Nathan’s mind was racing and he was trembling with anger and disbelief. He had never imagined that Knox Corporation would do such a sinister thing to innocent people. As he held back his anger, Nathan took a few deep breaths and attempted to regain his composure. He hid behind the other executives and listened to the chief executive’s orders. The chief told everyone to wear radiation suits and inspect the nuclear power plant. For the entire day, Nathan and the other executives monitored the plant inch by inch and recorded the temperature. At multiple points throughout the inspection, Nathan was very tempted to grab his phone and photograph all of the evidence. However, he refrained because he knew that individuals all around were actively watching him. At night, the chief executive gathered everyone and gave them a speech. He told them that the nuclear power plant’s waste was dumped every two months in an abandoned village called Elmwood Village and that no one would be harmed by the radioactive waste. After hearing this, Nathan was infuriated by Knox Corp.’s blatant lies. He quickly took out his phone and asked the chief executive to repeat what he had just said. As the chief repeated his words, Nathan started recording his words and sent them to Raynell. Now, he was sure that his plan would succeed.


        That night, as everyone fell asleep, Nathan secretly exited his camp and walked towards the factory. It was already midnight, and the factory had closed. However, there was still a squadron of SWAT guards patrolling the factory. Nathan hid behind the perimeter fence and inched his way to the back door. At the door, he swiped his ID and entered the factory. Nathan quickly navigated his way to the secret door and entered the nuclear power plant. In this plant, he proceeded to take a lot of photos, specifically of the interior and the exterior of the plant. When he was finished, Nathan snuck out of the power plant and tried to exit the building. All of a sudden though, an alarm went off! SWAT guards burst into the factory and immediately began  searching for Nathan. Nathan sprinted back inside the power plant and frantically sent the photos to Raynell. Just as he finished, the guards burst into the room. Nathen knew that he was going to be captured, so he threw his phone into the power plant’s core and prepared to die…






Chapter 11: The Evidence


At S.O.L.A.R. HQ…


        Upon midnight’s arrivals, Raynell suddenly received all of the messages Nathan had previously sent. He was surprised but nonetheless ecstatic to see that Nathan had finally cracked the code and found evidence of Knox Corp.’s illegal actions. After saving the photos and recordings into the S.O.L.A.R. database, he texted Nathan to ask how he was doing. However, after half an hour, Nathan still did not answer. He even tried to call him, but his phone was unresponsive. Now, Raynell started to panic. He knew that something must have happened to Nathan. He quickly called a meeting and informed everyone that Nathan was in grave danger. Robin was especially shaken by this since Nathan had been his best friend since kindergarten. However, he knew that there was still some hope. In addition, he also inferred that Knox Corp. would try to get information out of Nathan before executing him. Due to this, he told everyone to calm down and that he had a plan. Robin said that S.O.L.A.R. should secretly give the evidence to the government so they could rescue Nathan for themselves and arrest the heads of Knox Corp. Although the other members of S.O.L.A.R. were skeptical, they had no choice but to follow through with Robin’s plan.


3 hours later…


        Robin finished organizing all of the evidence and prepared to make the phone call. Since S.O.L.A.R. was a security and anti-crime organization, they had direct access to the phone number of the chief commander of the U.S. Army. After Robin dialed the number, his call was almost immediately answered. He introduced himself as a member of the Society of Liberation and Rescue, and he informed the chief commander of the population drop of Elmwood Village. Robin also told him that Knox Corporation was behind all of this, and showed the commander all of the evidence Nathan had gathered. The chief commander was appalled that Knox Corp. would do such a thing since three of his family members worked there. He also asked what the army could do to help resolve this situation. Robin informed him that they had an undercover agent in Knox Corp., but that he had been captured a few hours back. He also told the commander that S.O.L.A.R. wanted the army to secretly rescue Nathan and then raid the offices. The chief agreed and said that he would assign a task force to carry out the operations. Robin thanked him graciously and hung up.


Chapter 12: The Operation


U.S. Army HQ


        The chief commander immediately organized a task force after the phone call. He told them to secretly break into the offices and rescue a member of S.O.L.A.R. named Nathan. The task force he assigned was one of the best rescue forces in the entire army. It consisted of ten professionally trained officers with fifteen years of experience each. They were all armed with Vectors and MG36s and wore specially designed Kevlar suits. As they left for their mission, the chief commander informed S.O.L.A.R. and began to arrange an assault battalion.


S.O.L.A.R. HQ


        Robin and Raynell were ecstatic to hear that the task force had left but were also worried that Nathan would be executed before they arrived. They tried to gather as much information as possible and figure out where Nathan was being imprisoned. From what they knew, they inferred that Nathan was being kept on the third floor of the offices. It was where all of the confidential meetings were held, and where Knox Corp. kept all of its secret plans. It was also where the task force was headed…


The Knox Corporation Offices, Third Floor


        BANG! BANG BANG! SMASH! The gates of the offices collapsed as the specialized task force dove in. They threw smoke bombs and put on their thermal night vision goggles to see through the smoke. The offices erupted into chaos as everyone bolted out the door. The task force took advantage of this and quickly hurried up to the third floor. They broke through a steel door and entered the high-executive meeting room. There, they started searching for the place where Nathan was kept. After five minutes of inspection, they found a secret trapdoor under the meeting table. However, they didn’t immediately burst into the room. Instead, they sent down a few drones to survey the area. They found out that there was a jail room below the trapdoor reinforced with a row of turrets. The drones quickly fired at the turrets and successfully destroyed them. The task force then proceeded to open the trapdoor and approached the jail with caution. Inside, they found an unconscious man lying on the floor. The soldiers recognized him as Nathan Francis and quickly carried him out of the room. Just as they exited the room and closed the trapdoor, the alarm sounded. A message was broadcast over the intercom:


SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE INITIATED
CLUSTER MUNITIONS GOING OFF IN 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55…

The Outrage
By: Max Wang


Recap: In The Catalyst, we followed the story of Nathan Francis, a 23-year-old man from Elmwood Village. After photographing evidence of Knox Corp.’s illegal activities, Nathan wastaken prisoner and locked up in the Offices. Fortunately, he was able to send all of the evidence to S.O.L.A.R. HQ. After organizing the information, Robin contacted the U.S. Army and organized a task force to rescue Nathan. The operation was successful, and the soldiers carried Nathan out of the jail cell. As they closed the trapdoor that concealed the room, an alarm suddenly went off, and a message was broadcast over the intercom:


SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE INITIATED
CLUSTER MUNITIONS GOING OFF IN 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55…


Chapter 13: The Escape


        The task force instantaneously started bolting towards the exit. The commander ordered the strongest two soldiers to carry Nathan while the others guarded them. At half a minute, the soldiers had already arrived on the second floor, and they burst out the door with exactly ten seconds remaining on the timer for the self-destruct sequence. They hastily hopped onto their transport and sped away, while the Offices simultaneously blew up and erupted into a mushroom cloud. The booming noise woke the unconscious Nathan, and he slowly opened his eyes. The soldiers explained to him that he had been rescued and would be arriving at S.O.L.A.R. HQ in an hour. Nathan breathed a sigh of relief and closed his eyes again.
One hour later…


        The task force safely delivered Nathan to S.O.L.A.R. HQ where he was given a tearful welcome by Robin and Raynell. They all asked him how harshly Knox Corp. had treated him, and to their surprise, Nathan said that they didn’t really mistreat him in any way. However, he did say that they intended to put him in the electric chair to force out information. Thankfully, the guards arrived just in time to rescue Nathan before he was to be tortured. Afterward, the members of S.O.L.A.R. discussed the best way to denounce Knox Corp.’s sinister actions to the public. They decided that the heads of the company should be arrested first before the news came out. However, there was a slight problem: The infiltration of the Offices had alarmed the leaders, so they were now in hiding. Nathan also knew this, and he was ready to find them and bring them to justice.


        Chapter 14: The Hunt


        One fateful afternoon, Nathan called the U.S. Army headquarters and reported that he had collected key information as to the whereabouts of the leaders of Knox Corp. The night prior, he was thinking about where the heads of the company could hide when all of a sudden, he remembered something. Nathan remembered when he was just a cashier in Alpha Market, and when he didn’t know a single thing about the Knox Corporation. He could still clearly remember the day when the wall in the storage room of the market suddenly collapsed and almost crushed him. The official explanation was that the wall was ‘very old’, and that heavy rain had seeped through the roof and eroded the cement, thus causing the wall to collapse. At the time, Nathan believed this excuse, seeing as he had no other explanation. However, he had an alternative now: Hidden behind the wall was a secret room perfect for hiding people.


        After telling the chief commander about his suspicions, he was quickly assigned to a task force to investigate the whereabouts of the leaders of Knox Corp. That night, Nathan secretly infiltrated the Alpha Market alongside the task force and led them to the storage room. The soldiers quietly placed a C4 on the wall and waited for a few seconds before…BOOM! The bomb exploded and revealed a massive hole in the wall. The soldiers rushed in with XM8s while a group of soldiers carrying snipers stayed behind with AWPs. Nathan stayed in the middle with a Deagle in hand and warily entered the dark hole in the wall. As they ventured deeper and deeper, Nathan felt as though they were descending into a hideout. His suspicions were confirmed when he saw specks of light and heard shouting in the distance. The soldiers had also heard the noises, and they traced the source of the noise. Nathan followed behind, and after a minute or so, they arrived at another door. This time, however, it was adorned in decorations and vibrant paint. Nathan grasped that the leaders of Knox Corp. were most likely hiding in a room behind the door and that they were still unaware of the task force’s presence. As the commander gave a silent countdown, the soldiers readied their guns and prepared to burst in.


3…2…1…GO! GO! GO!


The soldiers and Nathan, charged in and immediately began arresting the heads of Knox Corp., one by one. They were all in shock and were horrified that the U.S. army [a][b]had come to apprehend them, so most of them simply surrendered and begged for mercy. A few others, however, were able to escape the fray and quickly disappeared down the massive hallway. The commander ordered a group of soldiers to pursue them, and Nathan immediately followed suit. He walked down to the farthest room and discovered a tunnel behind the king-sized bed. Nathan called for the members of the task force, and they accompanied him into the passage. After a while of crawling, they caught up with the fugitives and handcuffed them. The task force herded all of the convicts back into Alpha Market and intopolice cars called by S.O.L.A.R. Thus, the heads of Knox Corp. were captured, and all that Nathan needed to do was to reveal their crimes to the public.




Epilogue: 1 month later…


        Knox Corporation’s actions had been officially revealed to the public, and everyone was shocked. All of the stores Knox Corp. owned and operated were permanently shut down, and its leaders were expecting a trial soon. This scandal stayed on the breaking news list for nearly an entire month, topping the charts for the most viewed event in the 21st century.[c] S.O.L.A.R. began receiving wave after wave of media attention, and Nathan, Robin, and Raynell were awarded dozens of badges and honorable titles. However, the awards and the praise weren’t the things that made Nathan happy—instead, it was the new medicine that was developed for the people in his village who had contracted cancer because of Knox Corp.’s actions. Now, Elmwood Village was truly saved, and Nathan could finally breathe a sigh of relief. Yet, one thing remained true: Nathan Francis was a special man, with a special job, a special life, and a special past and future.[d][e][f]
[a]Just curious, do you know if the U.S. army has the authority to make such arrests?
[b]Great question! If the answer is no you could add a "police escort" to the story to make the arrests or you could simply change the military roll to "apprehending" the guilty parties.
[c]strongly encourage you to consider how short a time period one month is.
[d]I love this ending!
[e]Max, great job on this finale of Nathan's story and revealing the truth about the mysterious Knox Corp.! Your writing really brought the suspense to life. I made a few grammatical edits, but overall, your piece was great! Keep up the good work and thank you for your contribution to ICougar!
[f]MAX! Thank you so much for your continued hard work over the course of this year. I am truly excited to see what next year has in store for you and iCougar! Doubly excited to have you as a student in my 7th grade class!
